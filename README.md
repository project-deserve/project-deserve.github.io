## Project Deserved<a name=1></a>  
“Project Deserved” is a project put together by a group of volunteers with the goal of giving back to
underserved communities in Africa.

## Executive Summary<a name=2></a>  
We aim to provide health care access to indigent people in underserved areas in Africa.
Our strategy is to utilize volunteers in various capacities for the implementation. The initial team is
committed to setting up the first location with the hardware, software and all the logistics for a successful
launch.

Thereafter, we would encourage interested individuals to replicate the same solution in their chosen
underserve community with help from us.  

## Who We Are<a name=3></a>   
We are a group of professionals who desire to give back to underserved communities in Africa by providing
free healthcare access.

## Vision<a name=4></a> 
Everyone deserves to have good quality healthcare irrespective of their economic status. We aim to
provide this free of charge using our resources and donations from volunteers either in cash or in
expertise.

## Mission<a name=5></a> 
Our mission is to identify an underserved area, set it up for indigent people to visit virtually with a
volunteer healthcare provider who would remotely see the patient with the help of a nurse who is
physically present with the patient.

Based on the diagnosis, a prescription would be printed out for the patient to procure the medication and
also provide to the patient any follow up recommendation.

## Our Strategy<a name=6></a> 
We use volunteers for all the services rendered.

### Volunteers Needed<a name=7></a> 
The volunteers include:
- Doctors
- Nurses
- IT professionals
- Financial Donors
- Administrators

### Technology<a name=8></a> 
The technology employed includes:
-  Developed computer software to handle the visit
-  Computer to host the software
-  SIM card embedded in the computer to ensure Internet access
-  Internet access from a reliable service provider
-  Printer (to print out prescriptions)
-  Office supplies - e.g., ink, paper, etc.
-  Medical devices to capture vitals e.g., blood pressure monitor, glucometer, etc.
-  Location with electricity

## Service Location<a name=9></a> 
Modalities for the service are includes:
-  Reception Area
-  Consulting Room with privacy

## How it works<a name=10></a> 
We would install the software to capture the visit on a SIM carded embedded laptop which would
connect the patient in a private room to a virtual healthcare provider.

The nurse on ground would:
-  have the initial meeting with the patient,
-  check and record all the vitals in preparation for the consultation
-  Enter all the captured vitals on the computer prior to the patient’s meeting with the provider
Once the information has been captured for the healthcare provider, the patient is moved to the room
from the reception area so that the visit is conducted in private with the provider.
Any prescription or follow up recommendation is printed out and given to the patient for necessary
action.

We do not provide medication. We do not perform surgical procedure. We do not charge for doctor’s
visit. We provide access to meet with a healthcare provider free of charge.

## How you can help<a name=11></a>

-  Any other way you feel you can help

## Summary<a name=12></a> 
Together we can improve each other’s lives.
